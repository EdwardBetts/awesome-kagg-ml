# please insert good ideas for features

## first order features
x,y - thanks to rotation and trimming uninformative

## second order features
*between two points in time*
1. acceleration 
2. speed
3. angle
4. revisit - similar x,y visited again?

## third order features
*calculated from second order features*
1. mean speed, accelleration, angle(?)
2. curving - acceleration given angle, speed given angle, maybe classify angle in light, medium and sharp curves depending on duration, angle itself, ...?
